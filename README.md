# Scattering-inside-absorbing-medium
A Monte Carlo based model to simulate light scattering by transprarenet nanoparticles inside an absorbing medium. The model takes the chemical and physical properties of scattering particles and medium s input, and provide the relative abosorption of power with respect to a system without the presence of scattering particle. 

## Features
- Implements Monte Carlo-based photon transport simulation
- Models scattering, absorption, and photon step sizes
- Uses anisotropic scattering with adjustable parameters
- Supports boundary interactions and Russian roulette weight termination

## Requirements
The script is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## How It Works
1. Initializes photon packets with a defined weight and direction.
2. Simulates photon step sizes and scattering events.
3. Updates the photonâ€™s position and weight after each scattering.
4. Tracks energy absorption at each step.
5. Uses the Russian roulette technique to terminate low-weight photons.
6. Computes the total absorbed energy after simulating all packets.

## Parameters
| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Us`       | Scattering coefficient of the medium |
| `g`        | Anisotropic scattering factor (ranges from -1 to 1) |
| `ua`       | Absorption coefficient of the medium |
| `Lx, Ly, Lz` | Dimensions of the medium |
| `itr`      | Number of photon packets to simulate |
