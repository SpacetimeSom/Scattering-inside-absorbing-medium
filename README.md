# Scattering-inside-absorbing-medium
A Monte Carlo based model to simulate light scattering by transprarenet nanoparticles inside an absorbing medium. The model takes the chemical and physical properties of scattering particles and medium s input, and provide the relative abosorption of power with respect to a system without the presence of scattering particle.
